    *   Select any organization relevant to the technology policy domain and analyze a dispute resolution system in that organization. It may be a system for internal employee disputes or for external constituent/customer/client disputes. You may do this on your own or in a team of up to three people. Every person on the team must conduct at least one field interview of a stakeholder associated with this system. You are to plot the intended flow for the operation of the system (including appeal channels) and assess its strengths and limitations. Use analytic frameworks from the readings. To the extent possible, consider the impact of this system on technology policy outcomes.
